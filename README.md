## Credits

This project was completed as part of an Online Course on Udemy titled
**_Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS_** The website's
user interface was designed by the course instructor, **Jonas Schmedtmann**, and
students had to implement the website using HTML and CSS. Still, Jonas
guided students all the way through the implementation by providing walkthrough videos.
Therefore, I would like to thank Jonas for his tremendous commitment to his students
and for giving us this great project.
